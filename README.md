A TDD approach to the FizzBuzz exercise.

Desired behaviour:
To print a number and if the number is a multiple of 3, it should be replaced with "Fizz", a multiple of 5 replaced with "Buzz", and if a multiple of both, "FizzBuzz".
All other numbers print normally.

Steps:
1 - Create a gemfile
2 - Source (library), version of Ruby, ask for rspec
3 - Make a spec file
4 - Write and execute a test

Rules:
1 - Prints a number out
2 - If a multiple of 3 print "Fizz"
3 - If a multiple of 5 print "Buzz"
4 - If a multiple of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"
